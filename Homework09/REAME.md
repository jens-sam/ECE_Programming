# HW09 Instructions

Strings:
Strings are a fundamental part of all programs.  A string is simply a sequence of characters like this sentence. Since they are used so often, there are many special libraries and functions to manipulate them.  Manipulating them is an important skill.

hw09a.c:
Write a program hw09a.c which creates a constant string from the following
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"

print the length of the string as "The string is <num> characters long\n"
  
Find the index of the character 'z'
print it as "The letter z is at index <index>\n"
  
Find and print the third word in the sentence
print it as "The third word is <word>\n"
  
Find and print the word following "jumps"
print it as "The word after jumps is <word>\n"
  
Create another string
"Mary had a little lamb."
  
Create a new string using strcat()  that is the first two concatenated together with 2 spaces in between"
print the new string followed by a newline
  
hw09b.c:
  
Write a program that:
prompts the user to enter a filename.  Use this prompt
"Please enter a filename: "
  
prompts the user to enter a single word.  Use this prompt
"Please enter a word to search for: "
  
prompts the user to enter a single word.  Use this prompt
"Please enter a word to replace it with: "
  
reads the file and counts how many times that word is in the file
  
print how many times the word was found as "The word <word> was found <num> times\n"
  
Create an output filename from the input filename by taking the original filename and replacing its extension with the ".out" 
  (if it did not have an extension, add one)
  
strip off any path so that the file is created in the directory in which the program is run
  
write a new file with the output file name which is the original file but with the word that the user typed in replaced by the replacement word.
  
Make the replacement case sensitive
